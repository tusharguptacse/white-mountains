digital
holographic
process
are
discussed
and
applications
of
computer
holography
are
suggested
computer
holograms
have
been
made
of
three-dimensional
objects
which
give
faithful
reconstructions
even
in
white
light
a
new
approach
based
on
point
apertures
for
the
image
is
discussed
photographs
of
the
images
reconstructed
from
digital
holograms
are
