the

systems
are
sperry
univacs
large-scale
main

computer
systems
beginning
with
the
1107
in
1962
the
1100
series
has
progressed
through
a
succession
of
eight
compatible
computer
models
to
the
latest
system
the
1100/80
introduced
in
1977
the
1100
series
hardware
architecture
is
based
on
a
36-bit
word
ones
complement
structure
which
obtains
one
operand
from
storage
and
one
from
a
high-speed
register
or
two
operands
from
high-speed
registers
the
1100
operating
system
is
designed
to
support
a
