performance
of
rollback
recovery
systems
under
intermittent
failures
a
mathematical
model
of
a
transaction-oriented
system
under
intermittent
failures
is
proposed
the
system
is
assumed
to
operate
with
a
checkpointing
and
rollback/recovery
method
to
ensure
reliable
information
processing
the
model
is
used
to
derive
the
principal
performance
measures
including
availability
response
time
and
the
system
saturation
