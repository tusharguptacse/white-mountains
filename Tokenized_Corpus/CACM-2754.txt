a
syntactic
algorithm
for
peak
detection
in
waveforms
with
applications
to
cardiography
peaks
in
a
digitized
waveform
are
detected
by
an
algorithm
incorporating
piecewise
linear
approximation
and
tabular
parsing
techniques
several
parameters
serve
to
identify
the
waveform
context
enabling
accurate
measurement
of
peak
amplitude
duration
and
shape
the
algorithm
is
of
sufficient
speed
to
allow
on-line
real-time
processing
an
example
of
its
application
is
demonstrated
on
an
electrocardiogram
